-- Open Ended Questions

-- 1. Who are Fetchâ€™s power users?
/*
	Assumptions
    1. Power user could be defined as a user who makes the most purchases and/or who spends the most money.
    2. I assume that power users are those that made at least 10 transactions or have spent more than $100. 
     - According to my assumption, there are no power users. Hence, I will make another assumption that:
		power users are those that made at least 2 transactions or have spent more than $10.

    2. The products_takehome table contains a column category_2, which has the main product category value: "Dips & Salsa".
    3. I assume that the brand column in the products_takehome table indicates the brand of each product.

/*
	Assumptions
    1. I assume that growth is assumed to be based on total sales in the transaction_takehome table
    2. I assume year over year growth is defined by the percentage increase in total sales from one year to the next
    3. I will use the purchase_date column in the transaction_takehome table to return the year for each transaction.
