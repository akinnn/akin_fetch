## Key Data Quality Issues

While working with the data, I found the following issues that might impact my ability to draw accurate insights:

### Inconsistent Date Formats

The purchase_date field in the Transactions table sometimes includes time zone information (Z suffix) and milliseconds, while other entries lack this detail. This inconsistency can complicate date calculations and comparisons, such as year-over-year growth analysis.

### Incomplete Category Data

In the products_takehome table, some entries have NULL values in key categorical columns, like category_1 and brand. This limits my ability to accurately categorize and analyze sales trends by product type and brand.

### User Demographic Gaps

Some users are missing birth_date information in the user_takehome table, making it challenging to segment users by generation. This affects our ability to determine which demographics are driving certain product sales.

Could you help clarify the intended format for the purchase_date field and confirm whether any additional data cleaning steps are planned for these categorical fields?

### Interesting Trend

#### Top 5 Brands for Established Users

In the analysis, I discovered that the top 5 brands by sales among users that have had their account for at least six months are: Meijer, Skittles, Coors Light, Dove, Nerds Candy.
This suggests a strong interest in these products and could indicate an opportunity for targeted marketing campaigns.

### Request for Action

To further investigate these trends and ensure the data's accuracy, I would appreciate your support in addressing the following:

#### Standardizing the Date Format: 

Could we establish a consistent date format (perhaps ISO 8601 without the Z suffix) across the dataset?
Filling Data Gaps: 

If possible, obtaining complete product category and user demographic information will allow for more accurate trend analysis. Is there a way to backfill or correct these gaps?

#### Additional Context on Category Definitions: 

It would also be helpful to clarify how product categories, such as "Dips & Salsa" and "Health & Wellness," are defined. This will ensure that any insights drawn align with business expectations.
